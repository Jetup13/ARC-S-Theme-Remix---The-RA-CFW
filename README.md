Rework of a theme by Paul S. I made some aesthetic changes, changed the backgrounds. 

It has only two views: basic and detailed. 

Detailed only has one image for the roms (image name=“md_image”), I recommend using mix2 because it is the most complete as it shows screenshot, box, media and marquee.

Recommended options:

- Gamelist view in Auto 
- Transition style in instant 
- Show clock in ON 
- Battery Status in ON

I hope you like it

PS: 
It has just 1 bug that I dnt know how to fix. 
As I changed the Menu Background, all dialog boxes also have the same background, looks kinda weird xD but is just that. :p
